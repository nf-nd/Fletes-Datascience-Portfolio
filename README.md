# Datascience Portfolio Repository

This repository serves as an amalgamation of all my projects that are relevant to my skills and career as a data scientist. Inclusion of projects in this repository is done for the purpose of highlighting skills I feel potential employers and clients will value. Important projects will be grouped at the beginning of the portfolio, with following projects organized in chronological order. Each projects description includes a visual aid, a brief description of what the project is, and highlgihting of skills I believe are important.
